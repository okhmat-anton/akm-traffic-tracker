        <h3>About AKM tracker</h3>
        <p class="mt-4">
            AKM tracker is a web application designed to help you manage and track your affiliate marketing campaigns.
            It provides a user-friendly interface for managing offers, sources, reports, and domains.
            The application is built using modern web technologies, including Vue.js and Vuetify, to ensure a smooth
            and responsive user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application is designed to be easy to use, with a clean and intuitive interface that allows you to
            quickly navigate through different sections. You can easily add, edit, and delete offers, sources, and
            domains, as well as view detailed reports on your campaigns' performance.
        </p>
        <h3>About Pages</h3>
        <p class="mt-4">
            <b>Dashboard</b> — the main overview of your advertising performance. It displays real-time metrics like
            clicks, unique clicks, conversions, cost, revenue, and ROI. You can filter by date range and quickly spot
            trends, spikes, or drops in your campaigns. This is your central command center for quick insights.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
            <b>Campaigns</b> — these are traffic entry points that connect your sources with landing pages and offers.
            Each campaign defines the flow rules, country targeting, devices, rotation logic, and how tokens are passed.
            You control how traffic is routed and optimized using advanced rules and flow logic.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
            <b>Landing Pages</b> — these are pre-offer pages used to warm up visitors or capture data before redirecting
            them to the offer. In this section, you can upload landing files (ZIP, HTML, PHP), assign tags, and
            configure how landers behave inside campaign flows. You can also A/B test landers.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
            <b>Affiliate Networks</b> — this is where you manage your partnerships with external affiliate networks. You
            define the S2S postback structure, tokens, and offer tracking parameters. This helps you quickly assign
            affiliate networks when creating or importing offers, with consistent tracking setup.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
            <b>Offers</b> — the final destinations where your traffic is sent. Each offer includes a payout, targeting
            (countries), currency, tokens, and is linked to an affiliate network. Offers can be rotated in flows,
            paused, archived, or grouped by tags for better organization and performance tracking.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
            <b>Sources</b> — in the tracker, this defines your traffic source configurations. You can predefine UTM
            parameters, postback URLs, and token structures. This ensures that when traffic is coming from platforms
            like Facebook, TikTok, or Google Ads, it's cleanly tracked and conversions are returned properly via S2S
            postbacks.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
            <b>Reports</b> — your performance breakdown hub. Get detailed analytics on campaigns, landers, offers,
            countries, devices, conversions, and more. You can group by virtually any dimension, apply filters, analyze
            ROI, CR, EPC, and export reports for further optimization or team sharing.
        </p>

        {% if is_authenticated_user_type == 'admin' %}
        <p class="mt-4">
            <b>Domains</b> — manage your tracking and redirect domains. You can add custom domains, group them,
            configure HTTPS redirects, and assign specific domains to campaigns or flows. Important for brand safety,
            cloaking, and campaign isolation.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
            <b>Settings</b> — the system-wide configuration panel. Adjust timezone, currency, logging behavior,
            auto-refresh reports, token behavior, default parameters, and more. This section controls the backbone of
            how your tracker operates.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
            <b>Users</b> — manage access to your tracker. Create users, assign roles, and control login access. Only
            <code>tracker_admin</code> can hold administrative privileges. Ideal for team-based environments or
            separating client access.
